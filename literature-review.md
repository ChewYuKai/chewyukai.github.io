| Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition | 21/07/2019 | Architecture | Residual Networks make use of "shortcuts" connections which allow succeeding layers to build upon features learnt from previous layers. Shortcut connections also have the added benefit of allowing gradients to flow through them and hence, side-stepping the vanishing gradient problem. |
