# Review Meeting

## Session 1

### Papers for discussion

* Adversarial feature learning​
* Label-Removed Generative Adversarial Networks Incorporating with K-Means​
* Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features​
* Self-Supervised GANs via Auxiliary Rotation Loss

### Feedback

* Large k is ideal, more than what is required
* "Student is better than Teacher" Paper
* Novelty of rotation is likely due to data augmentation
* Bag-Of-Words
